This repository is built for the open data connector and case studies based on KNIME Geospatial Extension. 

Backgroud :KNIME AG and Harvard’s Center for Geographic Analysis have launched a joint project to advance spatial 
data science. The project is part of the Spatiotemporal Thinking, Computing, and Applications (STC)
Center which is funded by the NSF to enable pre-competitive research in partnerships among industry, 
academia, and government. The two-year project “Developing Workbenches for Spatial Data Science (HVD-21-07)”
will explore methodologies to advance spatial data science research and teaching.
To open up spatial analytics to a more diverse group of users, the partners will develop freely accessible 
KNIME Analytics Platform extensions for spatial statistics, modeling, and visualization. KNIME’s visual,
no-code/low-code environment will enable multi-discipline users to more easily and efficiently collaborate, 
explore data, and surface insights. Further resources in the form of workbooks, workflow-based case studies,
and best-practice workflows will be developed to help users get started with replicable and reproducible spatial 
data science across scientific disciplines.
