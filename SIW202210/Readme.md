KNIME workflow for Disparities in Healthcare accessibility

The accessibility of healthcare resources is closely related to the well-being of residents. How to measure residents' access to healthcare services, how to delineate healthcare service divisions, and how to optimize the layout of service facilities are important contents of healthcare service planning? Mastering the theories, models and tools of healthcare service accessibility analysis, and accurately judging, analyzing and planning the temporal and spatial allocation of healthcare services, will effectively improve public healthcare policies and improve residents' well-being.

To advance this goal and encourage more researchers and students to participate in the spatial study of public health, the Spatial Data Lab* will organize an online Spatiotemporal Innovation Workshop for public health with a focus on the new methodology, technology and applications in assessing the spatial inequality of healthcare accessibility.

The workshop aims to assess the spatial inequality of healthcare accessibility using KNIME, a data flow software.

Requirement: The hands-on training workshop is free to apply and the number of participants is limited to 15 people. It is desirable that those applicants have some background in geographic analysis and public health. Each participant is expected to complete a homework project. Those who complete the course will receive a certificate, and outstanding students will be invited to join the research team of the Spatial Data Lab for Healthcare Study.

EXPECTATION: Participants are expected to complete a group project. Those who complete the course will receive a certificate, and outstanding students will be invited to join the Spatial Data Lab research team.
